## Hard questions

> A prudent question is one-half of wisdom  
> – Francis Bacon

> I want my peace. I want to know how God created this world. I am not interested in this or that phenomenon, in the spectrum of this or that element. I want to know His thoughts, the rest are details  
> -- Albert Einstein

> One should use common words to say uncommon things  
> ― Arthur Schopenhauer

> I think it is always important to ask fundamental questions: but when we do ask a fundamental question, most of us are seeking an answer, and then the answer is invariably superficial, because there is no yes or no answer to life. Life is a movement, an endless movement, and to inquire into this extraordinary thing called life, with all its innumerable aspects, one must ask fundamental questions and never be satisfied with answers, however satisfactory they may be, because the moment you have an answer, the mind has concluded, and conclusion is not life, it is merely a static state.  
> So what is important is to ask the right question and never be satisfied with the answer, however clever, however logical, because the truth of the question lies beyond the conclusion, beyond the answer, beyond the verbal expression. The mind that asks a question and is merely satisfied with an explanation, a verbal statement, remains superficial.  
> It is only the mind that asks a fundamental question and is capable of pursuing that question to the end that can find out what is truth.  
> ― Jiddu Krishnamurti, Total Freedom

> So, monotheism explains order, but is mystified by evil. Dualism explains evil,  but is puzzled by order. There is one logical way of solving the riddle: to argue  that there is a single omnipotent God who created the entire universe – and He’s  evil. But nobody in history has had the stomach for such a belief.. The average Christian believes in the monotheist God, but  also in the dualist Devil, in polytheist saints, and in animist ghosts
