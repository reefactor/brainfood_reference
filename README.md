## Mental models

>  ..all models are approximations. Essentially, [all models are wrong, but some are useful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong).
> However, the approximate nature of the model must always be borne in mind..  
> -- George E. P. Box

> Each piece, or part, of the whole of nature is always merely an approximation to the complete truth, or the complete truth so far as we know it. In fact, everything we know is only some kind of approximation, because we know that we do not know all the laws as yet. Therefore, things must be learned only to be unlearned again or, more likely, to be corrected   
> -- Richard Feynman, [Lectures on Physics](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman#The_Feynman_Lectures_on_Physics_(1964)), [Lecture 1 - Atoms in Motion](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_01.html)

> You’ve got to have models in your head. And you’ve got to array your experience ‑ both vicarious and direct ‑ on this latticework of models. You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and in life. You’ve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head  
> -- Charlie Munger

> [A map is not the territory it represents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation), but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness  
> —  Alfred Korzybski, Science and Sanity

> The fool generalizes the particular; the nerd particularizes the general; some do both; and the wise does neither.    
..One of the failures of “scientific approximation” in the nonlinear domain comes from the inconvenient fact that the average of expectations is different from the expectation of averages..
Because our minds need to reduce information, we are more likely to try to squeeze a phenomenon into the Procrustean bed of a crisp and known category (amputating the unknown), rather than suspend categorization, and make it tangible. Thanks to our detections of false
patterns, along with real ones, what is random will appear less random and more certain — our overactive brains are more likely to impose the wrong, simplistic narrative than no narrative at all.  
The mind can be a wonderful tool for self-delusion, it was not designed to deal with complexity and nonlinear uncertainties.  
Counter to the common discourse, more information means more delusions: our detection of false patterns is growing faster and faster as
a side effect of modernity and the information age: there is this mismatch between the messy randomness of the information-rich
current world, with its complex interactions, and our intuitions of events, derived in a simpler ancestral habitat. Our mental architecture
is at an increased mismatch with the world in which we live.  
This leads to sucker problems: when the map does not correspond to the territory, there is a certain category of fool — the overeducated,
the academic, the journalist, the newspaper reader, the mechanistic “scientist”, the pseudo-empiricist, those endowed with what I call
“epistemic arrogance,” this wonderful ability to discount what they did not see, the unobserved — who enter a state of denial, imagining
the territory as fitting his map. More generally, the fool here is someone who does the wrong reduction for the sake of reduction, or
removes something essential, cutting off the legs, or, better, part of the head of a visitor while insisting that he preserved his persona with 95 percent accuracy.  
> -- The bed of Procrustes by Nassim Taleb


The world is huge and our sensory bandwidth is tiny and memory capacity is limited.

[Mental models](https://fs.blog/mental-models/) simplify huge complexity of the world
into [perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception#Types_of_perception)
and [reasoning patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory#System_2_in_humans).

This old idea is that the [learning is compression of the knowlege experience into hierarchies of abstractions](https://www.skynettoday.com/editorials/nooscope#the-learning-algorithm-compressing-the-world-into-a-statistical-model)

Shared models distill knowledge into the collective wisdom according to [DIKW pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid#Computational_representation) (which itself is a model too).

The Model does not give **the truth** yet posess certain tested [predictive power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_power).
With [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) You don't prove hypothesis (model) is true, you prove it **not yet wrong**.
Science is [falsifiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability). Best destiny for each theory (model) is to become corner case for a new more broad theory (e.g. Newtonian physics superseded by the General Relativity).

People have tried to label them to build taxonomies of most common models
in order to create reasoning frameworks and to put them in toolboxes.

And so there're [plenty of them online](https://www.google.com/search?q=mental+models)

### Iterator
#### Steep gradient ascent along learning curve

> Run Uphill. Simple heuristic: If you’re evenly split on a difficult decision, take the path more painful in the short term.  
> If you have two choices to make, and they’re relatively equal choices, take the path more difficult and more painful in the short term.  
> What’s actually going on is one of these paths requires short-term pain. And the other path leads to pain further out in the future. And what your brain is doing through conflict-avoidance is trying to push off the short-term pain.  
> By definition, if the two are even and one has short-term pain, that path has long-term gain associated. With the law of compound interest, long-term gain is what you want to go toward. Your brain is overvaluing the side with the short-term happiness and trying to avoid the one with short-term pain.  
> So you have to cancel the tendency out (it’s a powerful subconscious tendency) by leaning into the pain. As you know, most of the gains in life come from suffering in the short term so you can get paid in the long term.  
> -- The Almanack of Naval Ravikant

> Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.  
> ― Bill Gates

> To attain knowledge, add things everyday. To attain wisdom, remove things everyday  
> -- Lao Zi

> Warren and I are very good at destroying our own best-loved ideas. Any year that you don't destroy one of your best-loved ideas is probably a wasted year. Charlie likes the analogy of looking at one's ideas and approaches as "tools." When a better tool (idea or approach) comes along, what could be better than to swap it for your old, less useful tool? 'Warren and I routinely do this, but most people, as Galbraith says, forever cling to their old, less useful tools  
> -- Poor Charlie's Almanack

> The smartest people are constantly revising their understanding, reconsidering a problem they thought they’d already solved. They’re open to new points of view, new information, new ideas, contradictions, and challenges to their own way of thinking  
> -- Jeff Bezos

> Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have. That's what you do when [life is short](http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html)  
> -- Paul Graham

> Simplicity is hacking away the unessential. — It is not daily increase but daily decrease — hack away the unessential! The closer to the source, the less wastage there is  
> -- Bruce Lee

> Knowledge is subtractive, not additive — what we subtract (reduction by what does not work, what not to do), not what we add (what to do).  
.. They think that intelligence is about noticing things that are relevant (detecting patterns); in a complex world, intelligence consists in ignoring things that are irrelevant (avoiding false patterns).  
> -- The bed of Procrustes by Nassim Taleb


Iterate and refine models to sharp your [decision making skills](#decisions). Make [incremental improvements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen))

Use [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) when have competing models that make exactly the same predictions - the [simpler one is better](https://fs.blog/2019/10/occams-razor/). Follow [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), keep models [as simple as possible, but not simpler](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/). In the long term this prevents complexity growth, entangled and opaque structure.

Accumulated [knowledge asymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_asymmetry) yelds Power.


### Multidisciplinary skills
> And the models have to come from multiple disciplines—because all the wisdom of the world is not to be found in one little academic department. That’s why poetry professors, by and large, are so unwise in a worldly sense. They don’t have enough models in their heads. So you’ve got to have models across a fair array of disciplines  
> -- Charlie Munger / [A Lesson on Elementary Worldly Wisdom](https://fs.blog/great-talks/a-lesson-on-worldly-wisdom/)

> To the man with only a hammer, every problem looks like a nail

> There's multiple ways to succeed in life: 1) get to top 1% at 1 skill  2) combine top 10% of multiple skills 3) learn art of storytelling - powerful way to rule the world  
> -- Tim Ferriss podcast

> It’s kind of fun to sit there and outthink people who are way smarter than you are because you’ve trained yourself to be more objective and more multidisciplinary. Furthermore, there is a lot of money in it, as I can testify from my own personal experience  
> – Charlie Munger

> Interdisciplinary research is hard.. Say you get two world-leading experts, in maths and genomics – there obviously could be some crossover. But who is going to do the work to understand the other person's field, their jargon, what their real problem is? .. Some of the most interesting areas of science are in the gaps between, the confluences between subjects. What I've tried to do in building DeepMind is to find 'glue people', those who are world class in multiple domains, who possess the creativity to find analogies and points of contact between different subjects. Generally speaking, when that happens, the magic happens  
> -- [Demis Hassabis on hiring at Deepmind ](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepmind-protein-folding)

> An expert knows more and more about less and less until he or she knows everything about nothing.  
> A generalist knows less and less about more and more until he or she knows nothing about everything.  
> -- [attributed to various sources](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/10/25/more/)

> A fox knows many things, but a hedgehog one important thing  
> -- [greek poet Archilochus quoted by Isaiah Berlin to define a spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hedgehog_and_the_Fox)

> Foxes beat hedgehogs. And the foxes didn’t just win by acting like chickens, playing it safe with 60% and 70% forecasts where hedgehogs boldly went with 90% and 100%. Foxes beat hedgehogs on both calibration and resolution. Foxes had real foresight. Hedgehogs didn’t.  
> Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction by Philip Tetlock  

Move from I-shaped to T-shaped to Π-Shaped to M-shaped individual yet be aware of [Jack of all trades, master of none](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_of_all_trades,_master_of_none). The key here ballance factors:
* [The Pareto Principle in Learning – The 80:20 Rule](https://www.briantracy.com/blog/personal-success/how-to-use-the-80-20-rule-pareto-principle/) says that learning process isn't linear - you achieve 80% of result in the begining with only 20% of time. 
* [Speed of Obsolescence of Knowledge and Skills](http://career.iresearchnet.com/career-development/obsolescence-of-knowledge-and-skills/) at some point on a learning curve become greater than speed of your learning so the latter 20% isn't worth it
* M-shaped skills strategy gives exponential drop in competition among crossover experts with growth of M (Venn diagram of the overlap of M domains is exponentially small)
* Skewed Pareto distributions come from a Normal Distribution + Power of Accumulative Advantage over time.
Small differences multiplied by consistent performance accumulate disproportionate rewards over time.
So, in highly competitive zero-sum game, the Winner-Takes-All in ~rat race~[Red Queen's race](https://fs.blog/2012/10/the-red-queen-effect/)
* If I-shape is a result of [DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) strategy and jack-of-all-trades - result of [BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) strategy of knowledge space traverse given limited number of steps (life time and energy), then optimal  shape is the [A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) heuristic where Cost is proportional to depth and grows faster than the Value.


[Crossover experts](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepmind-protein-folding) are Π-shaped speciallists.

Single crossdomain B+ speciallist is better than 2 A+ with gap between domains because of the communication overhead.


### Metalearning

> The Three Stages of Cultivation  
> — The first is the primitive stage. It is a stage of original ignorance in which a person knows nothing about the art of combat. In a fight, he simply blocks and strikes instinctively without a concern for what is right and wrong. Of course, he may not be so-called scientific, but, nevertheless, being himself, his attacks or defenses are fluid.  
> The second stage — the stage of sophistication, or mechanical stage — begins when a person starts his training. He is taught the different ways of blocking, striking, kicking, standing, breathing, and thinking — unquestionably, he has gained the scientific knowledge of combat, but unfortunately his original self and sense of freedom are lost, and his action no longer flows by itself. His mind tends to freeze at different movements for calculations and analysis, and even worse, he might be called “intellectually bound” and maintain himself outside of the actual reality.  
> The third stage — the stage of artlessness, or spontaneous stage — occurs when, after years of serious and hard practice, the student realizes that after all, gung fu is nothing special. And instead of trying to impose on his mind, he adjusts himself to his opponent like water pressing on an earthen wall. It flows through the slightest crack. There is nothing to try to do but try to be purposeless and formless, like water. All of his classical techniques and standard styles are minimized, if not wiped out, and nothingness prevails. He is no longer confined.  
> -- The Warrior Within: The Philosophies of [Bruce Lee](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee) (1996) p. 108-109

> At the first level on the path he saw mountains as mountains and rivers as rivers.  
> On the second level of the path he saw that mountains are not mountains and rivers are not rivers.  
> And at a third level he saw once again mountains were mountains and rivers were rivers.  
> -- Zen teacher Qingyuan Weixin

## Reasoning

> It is important to view knowledge as sort of semantic tree. Make sure you understand the fundamental principles, ie the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.  
> -- Elon Musk

> I think it’s important to reason from first principles rather than by analogy. So the normal way we conduct our lives is, we reason by analogy. We are doing this because it’s like something else that was done, or it is like what other people are doing… with slight iterations on a theme. And it’s … mentally easier to reason by analogy rather than from first principles. First principles is kind of a physics way of looking at the world, and what that really means is, you … boil things down to the most fundamental truths and say, “okay, what are we sure is true?” … and then reason up from there. That takes a lot more mental energy  
> -- [Elon Musk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-s_3b5fRd8)

> In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is

> – Robert Kiyosaki

> Craftsman mindset focuses on what you can offer the world, the passion mindset focuses instead on what the world can offer you. This mindset is how most people approach their working lives  
> ― Cal Newport, So Good They Can't Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love

> Discover what you are best at doing and enjoy that is different from what all your peers are doing and that requires relatively little effort from you. Then put huge effort into honing that skill, so that it becomes monstrously greater than anyone else’s. Keep demanding that each year you make your peculiar talent more peculiar and much more potent. Use the skill to make the world a more interesting place. Don’t care about making money. If you have a fantastically different and useful skill, everything else you want will follow.  
> -- Richard Koch, The 80/20 Principle: The Secret to Achieving More with Less


Follow your intellectual curiosity. Love what you do - enjoy process, not results - otherwise you won't get through the hard times. 

Early in your carrier prefer [exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit) - take relatively big steps (diversification) in the search space. Later - decrease - move to intensification / exploitation. The strategy is similar to [Simulated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing).  
Deliberate experimentation (exploration, [BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)) is more efficient than deliberate practice in a rapidly changing world. [10000-experiment rule](https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/forget-about-the-10-000-hour-rule-7b7a39343523) beats [10000-hours rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)) (exploitation, "craftsman mindset", [DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search))

### Values

> You've got to serve somebody  
> -- Bob Dylan

> Principles are like lighthouses. They are natural laws that cannot be broken  
> ― Stephen R. Covey, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

> [Values are most important, abilities come next, and skills are the least](https://leadingbyreading.org/2019/08/14/mind-on-wealth-health-and-success-6-values-abilities-and-skills-what-comes-first-in-deciding-the-right-people-for-your-firm-a-management-case/)important. Yet most people make the mistake of choosing skills and abilities first and overlooking values. It is important for you to know what mix of qualities is important to ﬁt each role and, more broadly, what values and abilities are required in people with whom you can have successful relationships. In picking people for long-term relationships  
> -- Ray Dalio

> Of course if we make good things, it is not only to the credit of science; it is also to the credit of the moral choice which led us to good work. Scientific knowledge is an enabling power to do either good or bad — but it does not carry instructions on how to use it. Such power has evident value — even though the power may be negated by what one does with it.
>  To every man is given the key to the gates of heaven; the same key opens the gates of hell.
(Proverb of the Buddhist religion)
> What then, is the value of the key to heaven? It is true that if we lack clear instructions that enable us to determine which is the gate to heaven and which the gate to hell, the key may be a dangerous object to use. But the key obviously has value: how can we enter heaven without it?  
> -- Richard Feynman on [value of science and moral choice](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/07/19/richard-feynman-science-morality-poem/)

> If you can figure your life so that what you're genually doing is aiming to the highest possible good then the things that you need to survive and to thrive on a daily base will deliver themselves to you...
> If you dare to do the most difficult thing that you can conceptualize your life will work out better that it will if you do anything else. Well how do you find out if that's true, its a Kierkegaardian's Leap of Faith, there's no way to find out unless you do it, so no one can tell you either because if it works for some else, that's no proof that it;ll work for you. You have to be all-in in this game...
> If you manifest yourself properly in the world that those things will come your way.
> I've watched people operate in the world and I would say that There's no more effective way of operating than to conceptualize the highest good that you can and strive to attain it. There's no more practical way to a kind of success you would new if you only knew what success is  
> -- Jordan B Peterson [Biblical Series VII](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gFjB9FTN58&index=7&list=PL22J3VaeABQD_IZs7y60I3lUrrFTzkpat)

> Life is suffering and if you say it meaningless then your suffering is meaningless dumb and reckless. Find higher purpose and goal to suffer  
> -- Jordan B Peterson

> Loyalty in action, regardless obstacles or challenges, to one’s most cherished values, this is the essence of moral rectitude and it is the foundation of heroism  
> -- Andrew Bernstein, Heroes, Legends, Champions: Why Heroism Matters

> Nature loves courage. You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under, it will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. This is how magic is done. By hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering it’s a feather bed  
> -- Terence McKenna

> Begin with end in mind
> -- Stephen Covey

> Never prostitute your principles in your work. — I will never prostitute myself in any way that I do what I don’t believe in.  
> -- Striking Thoughts: Bruce Lee's Wisdom for Daily Living (2000) edited by John Little

> Your beliefs become your thoughts, Your thoughts become your words, Your words become your actions, Your actions become your habits, Your habits become your values, Your values become your destiny  
> — Mahatma Gandhi

> Ethical man accords his profession to his beliefs, instead of according his beliefs to his profession. This has been rarer and rarer since the Middle Ages.  
> Weak men act to satisfy their needs, stronger men their duties.  
> The difference between magnificence and arrogance is in what one does when nobody is looking.  
> Just as dyed hair makes older men less attractive, it is what you do to hide your weaknesses that makes them repugnant.  
> The best test of robustness to reputational damage is your emotional state (fear, joy, boredom) when you get an email from a journalist.  
> -- The bed of Procrustes: philosophical and practical aphorisms by Nassim Taleb

> If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?  ... During the life of any heart this line keeps changing place; sometimes it is squeezed one way by exuberant evil and sometimes it shifts to allow enough space for good to flourish. One and the same human being is, at various ages, under various circumstances, a totally different human being. At times he is close to being a devil, at times to sainthood. But his name doesn't change, and to that name we ascribe the whole lot, good and evil.

> Man! Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never going to die, and then dies having never really lived

Money is infinite and your time is not. When You're trading time for money, you cannot trade back.


#### Strategy
> Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth  
> -- Mike Tyson

> Plans are worthless, but planning is everything. There is a very great distinction because when you are planning for an emergency you must start with this one thing: the very definition of "emergency" is that it is unexpected, therefore it is not going to happen the way you are planning  
> — Dwight D. Eisenhower


#### Tactics
> The abstract summary of your actions is your strategy; what you'll do to implement the strategy is your tactics. Frequently, a strategy at one managerial level is the tactical concern of the next higher level.

##### Habits

> We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  
> -- Aristotle

> Our character, basically, is a composite of our habits. “Sow a thought, reap an action; sow an action, reap a habit; sow a habit, reap a character; sow a character, reap a destiny,” the maxim goes  
> ― Stephen R. Covey, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

> First we make our habits, then our habits make us  
> — Charles C. Nobel

> Humans are basically habit machines… I think learning how to break habits is actually a very important meta skill and can serve you in life almost better than anything else  
> -- Naval Ravikant

> Habit is the intersection of knowledge (what to do), skill (how to do), and desire (want to do)

Willpower requires conscious effort - energy inefficient. Habit is an automated unconscious process. 
Willpower is for sprint, Habit is for marathon.
Willpower is short-term tactics, Habit is for long-term strategy.

##### Journaling
> _JG:_ You've said that the Russian poet Yevgeny Rein once advised you to **keep your adjectives to a minimum and concentrate on nouns, even if the verbs suffer as a result**. Do you follow his advice?  
> _Joseph Brodsky:_ Yes, more or less. I'd say that's one of the most valuable pieces of advice I've received over the span of my literary career. If, for example, we were to wrap a poem in some sort of magical cloth which automatically removed the adjectives when you unwrapped the cloth, you should still have a lot of print on the page — verbs all over the place — but the adjectives, for the most part, should be as few in number as possible.  
> -- Conversations in Exile: Russian Writers Abroad John Glad - 1993 

> Писатели, чтоб ты знала, бывают двух видов. Те, кто всю жизнь пишет одну книгу – и те, кто всю жизнь пишет ни одной. Именно вторые сочиняют рецензии на первых, а не наоборот. И упрекают их в однообразии

##### Weekly retrospective

Notes grow over time. Merge notes into topics groups and prune bullshit. Groups form unstructured set of clusters.

The multitude of relations between topics is incomprehensible for conscious mind to grasp.

Accumulated knowledge graph can be _highlighted_ from a particular perspective (projection) with the 'spotlight of attention'. This spotlight structures subgraph in a tree (instant temporary [Mind maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map))

Trees of perspectives form a forest.
Trees grow over time - relations weights grow from subjective life experience.

Pruning trees is an essential part of active introspection, mental hygiene, since attention requires mental energy resources.

Review reading list of and pick what reasonates - next book for the upcoming week to read.

##### Sleep

Sleep is underrated in modern culture, yet is essential cognitive performance and memory consolidation. Sleep deprivation has detrimental effects on mental health.

#### Decisions

> The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.
One should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise. This philosophy fitted on to my early adult life, when I saw the improbable, the implausible, often the "impossible," come true.”  
> ― F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Crack-Up

> You can’t tell the quality of a decision from the outcome...  
> .. you make the best decision you can based on what you know, but the success
of your decision will be heavily influenced by (a) relevant information you may lack and (b) luck or
randomness. Because of these two factors, well-thought-out decisions may fail, and poor
decisions may succeed. While it might seem counterintuitive, the best decision-maker isn’t
necessarily the person with the most successes, but rather the one with the best process and
judgment. The two can be far from the same, and especially over a small number of trials, it can be impossible to know who’s who  
> -- Howard Marks memo: [You Bet](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/you-bet.pdf)

> Hard work is really overrated. How hard you work matters a lot less in the modern economy.  
> What is underrated? Judgment. Judgment is underrated. Can you define judgment?  
> My definition of **wisdom is knowing the long-term consequences of your actions. Wisdom applied to external problems is judgment. They’re highly linked; knowing the long-term consequences of your actions and then making the right decision to capitalize on that.**  
> In an age of leverage, one correct decision can win everything. Without hard work, you’ll develop neither judgment nor leverage.  
> You have to put in the time, but the judgment is more important  
> -- The Almanack of Naval Ravikant

> I’ve certainly been fortunate and it is **hard to actually figure out whether I was skilful at taking advantage of opportunities or just blind luck because you can’t actually run this experiment twice**.  
> What I do think is that as a society we attribute too much to luck. Luck is like an atheistic word for God: we ascribe things to it that we don’t understand or don’t want to understand. As a venture capitalist, I think one of the most toxic things to do is to treat the people I’m investing in as lottery tickets where I say: “Well I don’t know if your business is going to work. It might, it might not.” I think that’s a horrible way to treat people. The anti-lottery ticket approach is to try to achieve a high level of conviction, to ask: “Is this a business that I have enough confidence in that I would consider joining it myself?”

> -- The Most Important Thing by Howard Marks (paraphrasing _Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results_)

> If you stop to think about it, a pari-mutuel system is a market. Everybody goes there and bets and the odds change based on what’s bet.. Any damn fool can see the horse carrying a light weight with a wonderful win rate and a good post position etc., is way more likely to win than a horse with a terrible record and extra weight and so on and so on. But if you look at the odds, the bad horse pays 100 to 1, whereas the good horse pays 3 to 2. Then it’s not clear which is statistically the best bet..  
> -- The Art of Stock Picking by Charlie Munger

> A contrarian isn’t one who always objects—that’s a conformist of a different sort. A contrarian reasons independently from the ground up and resists pressure to conform.  
> Cynicism is easy. Mimicry is easy. Optimistic contrarians are the rarest breed.

> Much of the real world is controlled as much by the ‘tails’ of distributions as means or averages: by the exceptional, not the commonplace; by the catastrophe, not the steady drip….

> -- Philip Anderson, 1997, Nobel Laureate in physics 

> It seems like there are two degrees of freedom: you can choose the people whose opinions you care about (and on what subjects), and you can choose the timescale you care about them on. Most people figure out the former [1] but the latter doesn’t seem to get much attention.  
> You should trade being short-term low-status for being long-term high-status, which most people seem unwilling to do. A common way this happens is by eventually being right about an important but deeply non-consensus bet. But there are lots of other ways–the key observation is that as long as you are right, being misunderstood by most people is a strength not a weakness. You and a small group of rebels get the space to solve an important problem that might otherwise not get solved.  
> -- Sam Altman, [The Strength of Being Misunderstood](https://blog.samaltman.com/the-strength-of-being-misunderstood)

> Committees .. encourage collective rationalization of shared illusions generally believed, negative stereotypes of out-of-favor groups, techniques and individuals, unwarranted confidence in chosen approaches, unanimity, suppression of doubts and pressure on dissenters, docility on the part of individual members, free-floating conversations during meetings, and non-adherence to standardized methodologies  
> -- Hedgehogging, “Groupthink Stinks” by Barton Biggs 

> “_institutional behavior_” – an oft-heard phrase that’s rarely intended as a compliment - shared decision making, diffused responsibility, personal risk minimization, and go-along-to-get-along interaction.

... How could people miss such a point? Why do they confuse probability and expectation, that is, probability and probability times the payoff? Mainly because much of people's schooling comes from examples in symmetric environments, like a coin-toss, where such a difference does not matter.

_**Unknown unknowns**_ refer to risks invisible, unconsidered and unestimated e.g. [Black Swans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory)

> … Black Swans hijack our brains, making us feel we “sort of” or “almost” predicted them, because they are retrospectively explainable. We don’t realize the role of these Swans in life because of this illusion of predictability. Life is more, a lot more, labyrinthine than shown in our memory— our minds are in the business of turning history into something smooth and linear, which makes us underestimate randomness. But when we see it, we fear it and overreact. Because of this fear and thirst for order, some human systems, by disrupting the invisible or not so visible logic of things, tend to be exposed to harm from Black Swans and almost never get any benefit. You get pseudo-order when you seek order; you only get a measure of order and control when you embrace randomness.

> By grasping the mechanisms of antifragility we can build a systematic and broad guide to **nonpredictive decision making under uncertainty** in business, politics, medicine, and life in general— anywhere the unknown preponderates, any situation in which there is randomness, unpredictability, opacity, or incomplete understanding of things..

> It is far easier to figure out if something is fragile than to predict the occurrence of an event that may harm it. Fragility can be measured; risk is not measurable (outside of casinos or the minds of people who call themselves “risk experts”). This provides a solution to what I’ve called the Black Swan problem— the impossibility of calculating the risks of consequential rare events and predicting their occurrence. Sensitivity to harm from volatility is tractable, more so than forecasting the event that would cause the harm. So we propose to stand our current approaches to prediction, prognostication, and risk management on their heads.

> .. we can almost always detect antifragility (and fragility) using a simple test of asymmetry : **anything that has more upside than downside from random events (or certain shocks) is antifragile; the reverse is fragile**

> What is age? Is it the number of years you have lived? That is part of age; you were born
in such and such a year, and now you are fifteen, forty or sixty years old. Your body
grows old—and so does your mind when it is burdened with all the experiences, miseries
and weariness of life; and such a mind can never discover what is truth. The mind can
discover only when it is young, fresh, innocent; but innocence is not a matter of age. It is
not only the child that is innocent—he may not be—but the mind that is capable of
experiencing without accumulating the residue of experience. The mind must experience,
that is inevitable. It must respond to everything—to the river, to the diseased animal, to
the dead body being carried away to be burnt, to the poor villagers carrying their burdens
along the road, to the tortures and miseries of life—otherwise it is already dead; but it
must be capable of responding without being held by the experie nce. It is tradition, the
accumulation of experience, the ashes of memory, that make the mind old. The mind that
dies every day to the memories of yesterday, to all the joys and sorrows of the past—such
a mind is fresh, innocent, it has no age; and without that innocence, whether you are ten
or sixty, you will not find God.  
> -- Jiddu Krishnamurt, The Book of Life, Die every day

> ..On this account it is, that although the acquisition of fresh knowledge is the necessary precursor of every step in social progress,
such acquisition must itself be preceded by a love of inquiry, and therefore by a spirit of doubt;
because without doubt there will be no inquiry, and without inquiry there will be no knowledge.
For knowledge is not an inert and passive principle which comes to us whether we will or no; 
but it must be sought before it can be won; it is the product of great labor and therefore of great sacrifice.
And it is absurd to suppose that men will incur the labor, and make the sacrifice, 
for subjects respecting which they are already perfectly content.

> -- Czeslaw Milosz, from Unattainable Earth  

> The task of **setting free one’s gifts was a recognized labor in the ancient world. The Romans called a person’s tutelar spirit his genius.
In Greece it was called a daemon. Ancient authors tell us that Socrates, for example, had a daemon who would speak up when he was about to do something that did not accord with his true nature. It was believed that each man had his idios daemon, his personal spirit which could be cultivated and developed**..  
> According to Apuleius, **if a man cultivated his genius through such sacrifice, it would become a lar, a protective household god, when he died. But if a man ignored his genius, it became a larva or a lemur when he died**, a troublesome, restless spook that preys on the living.
The **genius or daemon comes to us at birth. It carries with it the fullness of our undeveloped powers. These it offers to us as we grow, and we choose whether or not to accept, which means we choose whether or not to labor in its service**. For, again, the genius has need of us. As with the elves, **the spirit that brings us our gifts finds its eventual freedom only through our sacrifice**, and those who do not reciprocate the gifts of their genius will leave it in bondage when they die..  
> Meister Eckhart, the fourteenth-century Christian mystic, presents a high spiritual statement of the commerce I have tried to outline between man and spirit. The specifics are quite different, of course, but the form of the exchange is the same as with the shoemaker and the elves or with the Roman and his genius, an escalating exchange energized, on the human side, by gratitude and culminating in the realization (and freedom) of the gift. For Eckhart, **all things owe their being to God. God’s initial gift to man is life itself, and those who feel gratitude for this gift reciprocate by abandoning attachment to worldly things, that is, by directing their lives back toward God. A second gift comes to any soul that has thus emptied itself of the world** — a Child is born (or the Word is spoken) in the soul emptied of “foreign images.” This gift, too, can be reciprocated, the final stage of the transformation being the soul’s entrance into the Godhead. Eckhart says: _“That man should receive God in himself is good, and by this reception he is a virgin. But that God should become fruitful in him is better; for the fruitfulness of a gift is the only gratitude for the gift.”_  
> If our lives are gifts to begin with, however, in some sense they are not _“ours”_ even when we become adults. Or perhaps they are, but only until such time as we find a way to bestow them. The belief that life is a gift carries with it the corollary feeling that the gift should not be hoarded. As we mature, and particularly as we come into the isolation of being “on our own,” we begin to feel the desire to give ourselves away in love, in marriage, to our work, to the gods, to politics, to our children. And adolescence is marked by that restless, erotic, disturbing inquisition: Is this person, this nation, this work, worthy of the life I have to give?

#### Developmental Stages

> In human existence there are seven times that we call “age”: infant, child, adolescent, young, adult, mature man, old man. The changing period of the Moon, during early childhood, is replaced by that of Mercury, in which the first knowledge is acquired, then that of Venus, which reveals its strength in the passionate emotions of adolescence; then comes the zenith of life, the three seven years of full life force and desires for expansion. The kingdom of the evil Mars generates a sudden change and leads to the struggles, bitterness and disillusions of adulthood. Then, under the scepter of Jupiter, once again appears a peak of life, maturity proper, which, wise and serene, contemplates the joys and sufferings of existence, always contributing joyfully. Finally, under the star of Saturn, slow and far from the earth, comes the great age in which the vital forces cool and slowly stop.

### Memento mori

> Death smiles at us all; all we can do is smile back  
> ― Marcus Aurelius

> The idea is to die young as late as possible  
> ― Ashley Montagu

> This life is only a prelude to eternity, where we are to expect another original, and another state of things. We have no prospect of heaven here but at
a distance; let us therefore expect our last hour with courage. The last, I say, to our bodies, but not to our
minds. Our luggage we leave behind us, and return as naked out of the world as we came into it. The day which we fear as our last is but the birthday of our
eternity; and it is the only way to it. So that what we fear as a rock, proves to be but a port, in many cases to be desired, never to be refused.
And he that dies young has only made a quick voyage of it  
> -- Seneca. Consolations against death
 
> Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.  
> The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.

> Acceptance of death. — The round of summer and winter becomes a blessing the moment we give up the fantasy of eternal spring.
Fluidity is the way to an empty mind. You must free your ambitious mind and learn the art of dying.

### Pointers of Truth

> When the sage points at the moon, the fool looks at the finger
>> Truth has nothing to do with language. Truth is like Moon in the sky and language is like the finger that points to the moon. A finger can point out where the moon is, but the finger is not the truth. You can see the moon without help of any fingers, can you?  
> -- Chan Buddhist scripture [Platform Sutra](https://www.quora.com/Does-the-saying-When-the-sage-points-at-the-moon-the-fool-looks-at-the-finger-really-have-Chinese-origins)

> The wisdom of the wise, and the experience of ages, may be preserved by quotations  
> ― Isaac Disraeli

> It is a good thing for an uneducated man to read books of quotations  
> ― Sir Winston Churchill

> The greatest thing in this world is not so much where we are, but in what direction we are moving.  
> ― Oliver Wendell Holmes

> Я всю жизнь выписывал пословицы, которые мне нравились своей глубиной и точностью. Причем, не просто выписывал, а искал и находил решение трудных проблем. Когда появлялись дети, и я им вместо пустых назиданий давал эти пословицы.
Очень часто сила, свет этих народных указаний выручала меня, подбадривала, наставляла, утешала.  
> ― Александр Солженицын

#### Limitations of language

> Wisdom cannot be passed on. Wisdom that a wise man attempts to pass on always sounds like foolishness..  
> .. One can pass on knowledge but not wisdom. One can find wisdom, one can live it, one can be supported by it, one can work wonders with it, but one cannot speak it or teach it. I sometimes suspected this even as a youth; it is what drove me from my teachers..   
> .. Words do no justice to the hidden meaning. Everything immediately becomes slightly different when it is expressed in words, a little bit distorted, a little foolish. And that too is good and pleases me very much. It is perfectly fine with me that what for one man is precious wisdom for another sounds like a foolery.  
> -- Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse.

> So, what is important is **not to ask, “What is the purpose of life, of existence?” but to clear the confusion that is within you. It is like a blind man who asks, “What is light?”** If I tell him what light is, he will listen according to his blindness, according to his darkness; but suppose he is able to see, then, he will never ask the question “what is light?” It is there.  
-- Jiddu Khrishnamurti, The Book of Life

> Asking science to explain life and vital matters is equivalent to asking a grammarian to explain poetry.  
> You cannot express the holy in terms made for the profane, but you can discuss the profane in terms made for the holy.  
> I realized that these sentences come naturally to me, almost involuntarily, in an eerie way, particularly when walking (slowly) or when freeing up my mind to do nothing, or nothing effortful I could convince myself that I was hearing voices from the other side of the veil of opacity. By setting oneself totally free of constraints, free of thoughts, free of this debilitating activity called work, free of efforts, elements hidden in the texture of reality start staring at you; then mysteries that you never thought existed emerge in front of your eyes.
