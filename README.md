## Gems of wisdom

> [Nanos gigantum humeris insidentes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants)

> I believe in the discipline of mastering the best that other people have ever figured out. I don't believe in just sitting down and trying to dream it all up yourself. Nobody's that smart  
> -- Charles Munger

> In my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject matter area) who didn't read all the time-none, zero  
> -- Charles Munger

> Repetitio est mater studiorum. Any kind of important book should immediately be read twice, partly because one grasps the latter in its entirety the second time, and only really understands the beginning when the end is known; and partly because in reading it the second time one’s temper and mood are different, so that one gets another impression; it may be that one sees the matter in another light  
> -- Arthur Schopenhauer on reading books.

> Fools say that they learn by experience. I prefer to profit by others experience.  
> ― Otto von Bismarck

> У разночинца биографии нет — есть только список прочитанных книг  
> -- Осип Мандельштам

## Mental models

>  ..all models are approximations. Essentially, [all models are wrong, but some are useful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong).
> However, the approximate nature of the model must always be borne in mind..  
> -- George E. P. Box

> Each piece, or part, of the whole of nature is always merely an approximation to the complete truth, or the complete truth so far as we know it. In fact, everything we know is only some kind of approximation, because we know that we do not know all the laws as yet. Therefore, things must be learned only to be unlearned again or, more likely, to be corrected   
> -- Richard Feynman, [Lectures on Physics](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman#The_Feynman_Lectures_on_Physics_(1964)), [Lecture 1 - Atoms in Motion](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_01.html)

> You’ve got to have models in your head. And you’ve got to array your experience ‑ both vicarious and direct ‑ on this latticework of models. You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and in life. You’ve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head  
> -- Charlie Munger

> [A map is not the territory it represents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation), but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness  
> —  Alfred Korzybski, Science and Sanity

The world is huge and our sensory bandwidth is tiny and memory capacity is limited.

[Mental models](https://fs.blog/mental-models/) simplify huge complexity of the world
into [perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception#Types_of_perception)
and [reasoning patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory#System_2_in_humans).

This old idea is that the [learning is compression of the knowlege experience into hierarchies of abstractions](https://www.skynettoday.com/editorials/nooscope#the-learning-algorithm-compressing-the-world-into-a-statistical-model)

Shared models distill knowledge into the collective wisdom according to [DIKW pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid#Computational_representation) (which itself is a model too).

The Model does not give **the truth** yet posess certain tested [predictive power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_power).
With [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) You don't prove hypothesis (model) is true, you prove it **not yet wrong**.
Science is [falsifiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability). Best destiny for each theory (model) is to become corner case for a new more broad theory (e.g. Newtonian physics superseded by the General Relativity).

People have tried to label them to build taxonomies of most common models
in order to create reasoning frameworks and to put them in toolboxes.

And so there're [plenty of them online](https://www.google.com/search?q=mental+models)

### Steep gradient ascent along learning curve

> Run Uphill. Simple heuristic: If you’re evenly split on a difficult decision, take the path more painful in the short term.  
> If you have two choices to make, and they’re relatively equal choices, take the path more difficult and more painful in the short term.  
> What’s actually going on is one of these paths requires short-term pain. And the other path leads to pain further out in the future. And what your brain is doing through conflict-avoidance is trying to push off the short-term pain.  
> By definition, if the two are even and one has short-term pain, that path has long-term gain associated. With the law of compound interest, long-term gain is what you want to go toward. Your brain is overvaluing the side with the short-term happiness and trying to avoid the one with short-term pain.  
> So you have to cancel the tendency out (it’s a powerful subconscious tendency) by leaning into the pain. As you know, most of the gains in life come from suffering in the short term so you can get paid in the long term.  
> -- The Almanack of Naval Ravikant

> Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.  
> ― Bill Gates

> To attain knowledge, add things everyday. To attain wisdom, remove things everyday  
> -- Lao Zi

> Warren and I are very good at destroying our own best-loved ideas. Any year that you don't destroy one of your best-loved ideas is probably a wasted year. Charlie likes the analogy of looking at one's ideas and approaches as "tools." When a better tool (idea or approach) comes along, what could be better than to swap it for your old, less useful tool? 'Warren and I routinely do this, but most people, as Galbraith says, forever cling to their old, less useful tools  
> -- Poor Charlie's Almanack

> Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have. That's what you do when [life is short](http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html)  
> -- Paul Graham

> Simplicity is hacking away the unessential. — It is not daily increase but daily decrease — hack away the unessential! The closer to the source, the less wastage there is  
> -- Bruce Lee


Iterate and refine models to sharp your [decision making skills](#decisions). Make [incremental improvements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen))

Use [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) when have competing models that make exactly the same predictions - the [simpler one is better](https://fs.blog/2019/10/occams-razor/). Follow [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), keep models [as simple as possible, but not simpler](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/). In the long term this prevents complexity growth, entangled and opaque structure.

Accumulated [knowledge asymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_asymmetry) yelds Power.


### Multidisciplinary skills
> And the models have to come from multiple disciplines—because all the wisdom of the world is not to be found in one little academic department. That’s why poetry professors, by and large, are so unwise in a worldly sense. They don’t have enough models in their heads. So you’ve got to have models across a fair array of disciplines  
> -- Charlie Munger / [A Lesson on Elementary Worldly Wisdom](https://fs.blog/great-talks/a-lesson-on-worldly-wisdom/)

> To the man with only a hammer, every problem looks like a nail

> There's multiple ways to succeed in life: 1) get to top 1% at 1 skill  2) combine top 10% of multiple skills 3) learn art of storytelling - powerful way to rule the world  
> -- Tim Ferriss podcast

> It’s kind of fun to sit there and outthink people who are way smarter than you are because you’ve trained yourself to be more objective and more multidisciplinary. Furthermore, there is a lot of money in it, as I can testify from my own personal experience  
> – Charlie Munger

> Interdisciplinary research is hard.. Say you get two world-leading experts, in maths and genomics – there obviously could be some crossover. But who is going to do the work to understand the other person's field, their jargon, what their real problem is? .. Some of the most interesting areas of science are in the gaps between, the confluences between subjects. What I've tried to do in building DeepMind is to find 'glue people', those who are world class in multiple domains, who possess the creativity to find analogies and points of contact between different subjects. Generally speaking, when that happens, the magic happens  
> -- [Demis Hassabis on hiring at Deepmind ](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepmind-protein-folding)

> An expert knows more and more about less and less until he or she knows everything about nothing.  
> A generalist knows less and less about more and more until he or she knows nothing about everything.  
> -- [attributed to various sources](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/10/25/more/)

> A fox knows many things, but a hedgehog one important thing  
> -- [greek poet Archilochus quoted by Isaiah Berlin to define a spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hedgehog_and_the_Fox)

Move from I-shaped to T-shaped to Π-Shaped to M-shaped individual yet be aware of [Jack of all trades, master of none](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_of_all_trades,_master_of_none). The key here ballance factors:
* [The Pareto Principle in Learning – The 80:20 Rule](https://www.briantracy.com/blog/personal-success/how-to-use-the-80-20-rule-pareto-principle/) says that learning process isn't linear - you achieve 80% of result in the begining with only 20% of time. 
* [Speed of Obsolescence of Knowledge and Skills](http://career.iresearchnet.com/career-development/obsolescence-of-knowledge-and-skills/) at some point on a learning curve become greater than speed of your learning so the latter 20% isn't worth it
* M-shaped skills strategy gives exponential drop in competition among crossover experts with growth of M (Venn diagram of the overlap of M domains is exponentially small)
* Skewed Pareto distributions come from a Normal Distribution + Power of Accumulative Advantage over time.
Small differences multiplied by consistent performance accumulate disproportionate rewards over time.
So, in highly competitive zero-sum game, the Winner-Takes-All in ~rat race~[Red Queen's race](https://fs.blog/2012/10/the-red-queen-effect/)
* If I-shape is a result of [DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) strategy and jack-of-all-trades - result of [BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) strategy of knowledge space traverse given limited number of steps (life time and energy), then optimal  shape is the [A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) heuristic where Cost is proportional to depth and grows faster than the Value.


[Crossover experts](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepmind-protein-folding) are Π-shaped speciallists.

Single crossdomain B+ speciallist is better than 2 A+ with gap between domains because of the communication overhead.


### Common sense
> What important truth do very few people agree with you on?  
> -- Peter Thiel, Zero to One

> Common sense is nothing but a collection of misconceptions acquired by age 18  
> -- Einstein

> Bet against the consensus (being entrepreneur)  
> -- Ray Dalio

> If you stop to think about it, a pari-mutuel system is a market. Everybody goes there and bets and the odds change based on what’s bet.. Any damn fool can see the horse carrying a light weight with a wonderful win rate and a good post position etc., is way more likely to win than a horse with a terrible record and extra weight and so on and so on. But if you look at the odds, the bad horse pays 100 to 1, whereas the good horse pays 3 to 2. Then it’s not clear which is statistically the best bet..  
> -- The Art of Stock Picking by Charlie Munger

> How could people miss such a point? Why do they confuse probability and expectation, that is, probability and probability times the payoff? Mainly because much of people's schooling comes from examples in symmetric environments, like a coin-toss, where such a difference does not matter. In fact the so-called "Bell Curve" that seems to have found universal use in society is entirely symmetric  
> -- Fooled by Randomness Role of Chance in Markets and Life by Nassim Nicholas Taleb

> A contrarian isn’t one who always objects—that’s a conformist of a different sort. A contrarian reasons independently from the ground up and resists pressure to conform.  
> Cynicism is easy. Mimicry is easy. Optimistic contrarians are the rarest breed.  
> -- The Almanack of Naval Ravikant

> Much of the real world is controlled as much by the ‘tails’ of distributions as means or averages: by the exceptional, not the commonplace; by the catastrophe, not the steady drip…. 
> We need to free ourselves from ‘average’ thinking  
> -- Philip Anderson, 1997, Nobel Laureate in physics 

> It seems like there are two degrees of freedom: you can choose the people whose opinions you care about (and on what subjects), and you can choose the timescale you care about them on. Most people figure out the former [1] but the latter doesn’t seem to get much attention.  
> You should trade being short-term low-status for being long-term high-status, which most people seem unwilling to do. A common way this happens is by eventually being right about an important but deeply non-consensus bet. But there are lots of other ways–the key observation is that as long as you are right, being misunderstood by most people is a strength not a weakness. You and a small group of rebels get the space to solve an important problem that might otherwise not get solved.  
> -- Sam Altman, [The Strength of Being Misunderstood](https://blog.samaltman.com/the-strength-of-being-misunderstood)

Challenge beliefs & persist. Disagree & commit. Make asymmetric bets.

> ― Cal Newport, So Good They Can't Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love

Follow your intellectual curiosity. Love what you do - enjoy process, not results - otherwise you won't get through the hard times. 

Early in your carrier prefer [exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit) - take relatively big steps (diversification) in the search space. Later - decrease - move to intensification / exploitation. The strategy is similar to [Simulated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing).  
Deliberate experimentation (exploration, [BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)) is more efficient than deliberate practice in a rapidly changing world. [10000-experiment rule](https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/forget-about-the-10-000-hour-rule-7b7a39343523) beats [10,000-hours rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)) (exploitation, "craftsman mindset", [DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search))

Later focus on the chosen path with [Warren Buffett's 5/25 Rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkhtYs22bLI)


#### Values

> You've got to serve somebody  
> -- Bob Dylan

> Principles are like lighthouses. They are natural laws that cannot be broken  
> ― Stephen R. Covey, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

> -- Ray Dalio

> Of course if we make good things, it is not only to the credit of science; it is also to the credit of the moral choice which led us to good work. Scientific knowledge is an enabling power to do either good or bad — but it does not carry instructions on how to use it. Such power has evident value — even though the power may be negated by what one does with it.
>  To every man is given the key to the gates of heaven; the same key opens the gates of hell.
(Proverb of the Buddhist religion)
> What then, is the value of the key to heaven? It is true that if we lack clear instructions that enable us to determine which is the gate to heaven and which the gate to hell, the key may be a dangerous object to use. But the key obviously has value: how can we enter heaven without it?  
> -- Richard Feynman on [value of science and moral choice](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/07/19/richard-feynman-science-morality-poem/)

> If you can figure your life so that what you're genually doing is aiming to the highest possible good then the things that you need to survive and to thrive on a daily base will deliver themselves to you...
> If you dare to do the most difficult thing that you can conceptualize your life will work out better that it will if you do anything else. Well how do you find out if that's true, its a Kierkegaardian's Leap of Faith, there's no way to find out unless you do it, so no one can tell you either because if it works for some else, that's no proof that it;ll work for you. You have to be all-in in this game...
> If you manifest yourself properly in the world that those things will come your way.
> I've watched people operate in the world and I would say that There's no more effective way of operating than to conceptualize the highest good that you can and strive to attain it. There's no more practical way to a kind of success you would new if you only knew what success is  
> -- Jordan B Peterson [Biblical Series VII](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gFjB9FTN58&index=7&list=PL22J3VaeABQD_IZs7y60I3lUrrFTzkpat)

> Life is suffering and if you say it meaningless then your suffering is meaningless dumb and reckless. Find higher purpose and goal to suffer  
> -- Jordan B Peterson

> Loyalty in action, regardless obstacles or challenges, to one’s most cherished values—this is the essence of moral rectitude—and it is the foundation of heroism  
> -- Andrew Bernstein, Heroes, Legends, Champions: Why Heroism Matters

> Nature loves courage. You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under, it will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. This is how magic is done. By hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering it’s a feather bed

##### Time
> Value your time, it’s all you have  
> -- Naval Ravikant

> No “yes.” [Either “HELL YEAH!” or “no.”](https://sive.rs/hellyeah)  
> -- Derek Sivers [hellyeah rule](https://sive.rs/hellyeah)

> Learn to say 'no' to the good so you can say 'yes' to the best  
> ― John C. Maxwell

> Man! Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never going to die, and then dies having never really lived  
> -- The Dalai Lama XIV (when asked what surprised him most about humanity)


Money is infinite and your time is not. When You're trading time for money, you cannot trade back.


#### Strategy
> Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth  
> -- Mike Tyson

> Plans are worthless, but planning is everything. There is a very great distinction because when you are planning for an emergency you must start with this one thing: the very definition of "emergency" is that it is unexpected, therefore it is not going to happen the way you are planning  
> — Dwight D. Eisenhower


#### Tactics
> The abstract summary of your actions is your strategy; what you'll do to implement the strategy is your tactics. Frequently, a strategy at one managerial level is the tactical concern of the next higher level.
> — Andy Grove (High Output Management)

> Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat  
> — Sun Tzu

> -- Chuck Close

Amateurs have a goal. [Professionals have a process](https://fs.blog/2017/06/habits-vs-goals/).

##### Habits

> First we make our habits, then our habits make us  
> — Charles C. Nobel

> Humans are basically habit machines… I think learning how to break habits is actually a very important meta skill and can serve you in life almost better than anything else  
> -- Naval Ravikant

> Habit is the intersection of knowledge (what to do), skill (how to do), and desire (want to do)  
> — Stephen Covey

> The second half of a man's life is made up of nothing but the habits he has acquired during the first half  
> ― Demons novel by Fyodor Dostoevsky

* Nulla dies sine **code** linea **commit**
* Calm stressed mind with [Yoga Nidra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_nidra) recorded audio session

Willpower requires conscious effort - energy inefficient. Habit is an automated unconscious process. 
Willpower is for sprint, Habit is for marathon.
Willpower is short-term tactics, Habit is for long-term strategy.

##### Journaling
> _JG:_ You've said that the Russian poet Yevgeny Rein once advised you to **keep your adjectives to a minimum and concentrate on nouns, even if the verbs suffer as a result**. Do you follow his advice?  
> _Joseph Brodsky:_ Yes, more or less. I'd say that's one of the most valuable pieces of advice I've received over the span of my literary career. If, for example, we were to wrap a poem in some sort of magical cloth which automatically removed the adjectives when you unwrapped the cloth, you should still have a lot of print on the page — verbs all over the place — but the adjectives, for the most part, should be as few in number as possible.  
> -- Conversations in Exile: Russian Writers Abroad John Glad - 1993 

> Писатели, чтоб ты знала, бывают двух видов. Те, кто всю жизнь пишет одну книгу – и те, кто всю жизнь пишет ни одной. Именно вторые сочиняют рецензии на первых, а не наоборот. И упрекают их в однообразии

##### Weekly retrospective

Notes grow over time. Merge notes into topics groups and prune bullshit. Groups form unstructured set of clusters.

The multitude of relations between topics is incomprehensible for conscious mind to grasp.

Accumulated knowledge graph can be _highlighted_ from a particular perspective (projection) with the 'spotlight of attention'. This spotlight structures subgraph in a tree (instant temporary [Mind maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map))

Trees of perspectives form a forest.
Trees grow over time - relations weights grow from subjective life experience.

Pruning trees is an essential part of active introspection, mental hygiene, since attention requires mental energy resources.


##### Sleep

Sleep is underrated in modern culture, yet is essential cognitive performance and memory consolidation. Sleep deprivation has detrimental effects on mental health.

#### Decisions

> The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.
One should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise. This philosophy fitted on to my early adult life, when I saw the improbable, the implausible, often the "impossible," come true.”  
> ― F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Crack-Up

> You can’t tell the quality of a decision from the outcome...  
> .. you make the best decision you can based on what you know, but the success
of your decision will be heavily influenced by (a) relevant information you may lack and (b) luck or
randomness. Because of these two factors, well-thought-out decisions may fail, and poor
decisions may succeed. While it might seem counterintuitive, the best decision-maker isn’t
necessarily the person with the most successes, but rather the one with the best process and
judgment. The two can be far from the same, and especially over a small number of trials, it can be impossible to know who’s who  
> -- Howard Marks memo: [You Bet](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/you-bet.pdf)

> Hard work is really overrated. How hard you work matters a lot less in the modern economy.  
> What is underrated? Judgment. Judgment is underrated. Can you define judgment?  
> My definition of **wisdom is knowing the long-term consequences of your actions. Wisdom applied to external problems is judgment. They’re highly linked; knowing the long-term consequences of your actions and then making the right decision to capitalize on that.**  
> In an age of leverage, one correct decision can win everything. Without hard work, you’ll develop neither judgment nor leverage.  
> You have to put in the time, but the judgment is more important  
> -- The Almanack of Naval Ravikant

> I’ve certainly been fortunate and it is **hard to actually figure out whether I was skilful at taking advantage of opportunities or just blind luck because you can’t actually run this experiment twice**.  
> What I do think is that as a society we attribute too much to luck. Luck is like an atheistic word for God: we ascribe things to it that we don’t understand or don’t want to understand. As a venture capitalist, I think one of the most toxic things to do is to treat the people I’m investing in as lottery tickets where I say: “Well I don’t know if your business is going to work. It might, it might not.” I think that’s a horrible way to treat people. The anti-lottery ticket approach is to try to achieve a high level of conviction, to ask: “Is this a business that I have enough confidence in that I would consider joining it myself?”

##### Uncertainty

> We have two classes of forecasters:  Those who don’t know – and those who don’t know they don’t know  
> -- John Kenneth Galbraith

> Forecasts usually tell us more of the forecaster than of the future  
> -- Warren Buffett

> Those who have knowledge don’t predict; those who predict don’t have knowledge.  
> -- Lao Tzu

> There are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don't know we don't know  
> -- Rumsfeld [DoD speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns)

> Beyond these three categories there is a fourth, the unknown known, that which we intentionally refuse to acknowledge that we know  
> -- attributed to Slavoj Žižek

> People can foresee the future only when it coincides with their own wishes, and the most grossly obvious facts can be ignored when they are unwelcome  
> -- George Orwell

> The field of economics is muddled and imprecise, and there’s good reason it’s called “the dismal science.” Unlike a "real" science like physics, in economics there are no rules that one can count on to consistently produce a given outcome, as in “if a, then b.” There are only patterns that tend to repeat, and while they may be historical, logical and often-observed, they’re still only tendencies.  
> -- Howard Marks ["Uncertainty" memo](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/uncertainty.pdf)

> .. a lot of that extrapolation – and just about all the rest of our conclusions – consists of what Lipsitch calls opinion or speculation and what I call guesswork. (George Bernard Shaw said, “All professions are conspiracies against the laity.” Thus the rules of the investment profession seem to require that its members describe their views about the future using highsounding terms like “analysis,” “assessment,” “projection,” “prediction” and “forecast.” Rarely do we see the word “guess.”)  
> -- Howard Marks Memo: [Knowledge Of The Future](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/docs/default-source/memos/knowledge-of-the-future.pdf)

> Overconfidence .. the most significant of the cognitive biases.  
> -- Daniel Kahneman in Thinking Fast and Slow book


_**Known knowns**_ refer to a high level of confidence, yet [overconfidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overconfidence_effect) is _the most significant of the cognitive biases_.

> It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so  
> -- Mark Twain, but also to several others:

People with low ability at a task [overestimate their ability (Dunning–Kruger effect
)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) at the same time high-achievers suffer from opposite cognitive bias - [underestimate themselves (impostor syndrome)
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)


_**Known unknowns**_ refer to considered "risks" under [estimated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment) uncertainty so it can be [managed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management)

Life is a game with [incomplete and imperfect information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_information#Complete_versus_perfect_information), so people have developed frameworks to estimate confidence when [managing decisions under uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management).


Three factors: hidden information, skill, and luck. 
| Game | Hidden information | Skill | Luck |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chess      |   | X |   |
| Roulette   |   |   | X |
| Backgammon |   | X | X |
| Blackjack, poker   | X  | X | X |


_**Unknown unknowns**_ refer to risks invisible, unconsidered and unestimated e.g. [Black Swans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory)

> … Black Swans hijack our brains, making us feel we “sort of” or “almost” predicted them, because they are retrospectively explainable. We don’t realize the role of these Swans in life because of this illusion of predictability. Life is more, a lot more, labyrinthine than shown in our memory— our minds are in the business of turning history into something smooth and linear, which makes us underestimate randomness. But when we see it, we fear it and overreact. Because of this fear and thirst for order, some human systems, by disrupting the invisible or not so visible logic of things, tend to be exposed to harm from Black Swans and almost never get any benefit. You get pseudo-order when you seek order; you only get a measure of order and control when you embrace randomness.

> By grasping the mechanisms of antifragility we can build a systematic and broad guide to **nonpredictive decision making under uncertainty** in business, politics, medicine, and life in general— anywhere the unknown preponderates, any situation in which there is randomness, unpredictability, opacity, or incomplete understanding of things..

> It is far easier to figure out if something is fragile than to predict the occurrence of an event that may harm it. Fragility can be measured; risk is not measurable (outside of casinos or the minds of people who call themselves “risk experts”). This provides a solution to what I’ve called the Black Swan problem— the impossibility of calculating the risks of consequential rare events and predicting their occurrence. Sensitivity to harm from volatility is tractable, more so than forecasting the event that would cause the harm. So we propose to stand our current approaches to prediction, prognostication, and risk management on their heads.

> .. we can almost always detect antifragility (and fragility) using a simple test of asymmetry : **anything that has more upside than downside from random events (or certain shocks) is antifragile; the reverse is fragile**  
> --  Nassim Taleb in Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder

Antifragility is the antidote to [Black Swans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory).


_**Unknown knowns**_ refer to cognitive bias of self-denial to accept new facts - [evidence that challenges prior belief system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem)

> The first principle is that you must not fool yourself- and you are the easiest person to fool  
> -- Richard Feynman

> Who has deceived thee so often as thy self  
> -- Benjamin Franklin

> One definition of a moment of suffering is “the moment when you see things exactly the way they are.” This whole time, you’ve been convinced your business is doing great, and really, you’ve ignored the signs it’s not doing well. Then, your business fails, and you suffer because you’ve been putting off reality. You’ve been hiding it from yourself  
> -- The Almanack of Naval Ravikant


## Introspect

> We don’t see things as they are, but as we are  
> — Anaïs Nin

> All of human unhappiness comes from one single thing: not knowing how to remain at rest in a room  
> — Blaise Pascal

> Empty your mind, be water my friend  
> -- Bruce Lee

### Transcend

> The essentially self-transcendent quality of human existence renders man a being reaching out beyond himself  
> -- Viktor Frankl, The will to meaning

> Man's main task in life is to give birth to himself, to become what he potentially is. The most important product of his effort is his own personality  
> ― Erich Fromm

> What a man can be, he must be  
> -- Abraham Maslow in [Motivation and personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs#cite_note-Maslow,_A._1954-5)

> One can choose to go back toward safety or forward toward growth. Growth must be chosen again and again; fear must be overcome again and again  
> ― Abraham Maslow

> It is a fundamental law of nature that to evolve one has to push one’s limits, which is painful, in order to  gain strength—whether it’s in the form of lifting weights, facing problems head-on, or in any other way  
> -- Ray Dalio, Principles

> We cannot become what we need to be by remaining what we are  
>  -- Max de Pree

> Man is something that shall be overcome. Man is a rope, tied between beast and overman — a rope over an abyss. What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end.  
> You must be ready to burn yourself in your own flame; how could you rise anew if you have not first become ashes?  
> ― Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, Thus Spoke Zarathustra

> Thus it can be seen that mental health is based on a certain degree of tension, the tension between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish, or the gap between what one is and what one should become. Such a tension is inherent in the human being and therefore is indispensable to mental well-being  
> -- Victor Frankl

> When once you have tasted flight, you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward, for there you have been and there you will always long to return   
> -- Leonardo da Vinci

> If there is no further growth, then sunset is near  
> -- Seneca

> Tension is who you think you should be. Relaxation is who you are  
> — Buddhist saying

> To express yourself in freedom, you must die to everything of yesterday. From the ‘old’, you derive security; from the ‘new’, you gain the flow  
> – Bruce Lee

> What is age? Is it the number of years you have lived? That is part of age; you were born
in such and such a year, and now you are fifteen, forty or sixty years old. Your body
grows old—and so does your mind when it is burdened with all the experiences, miseries
and weariness of life; and such a mind can never discover what is truth. The mind can
discover only when it is young, fresh, innocent; but innocence is not a matter of age. It is
not only the child that is innocent—he may not be—but the mind that is capable of
experiencing without accumulating the residue of experience. The mind must experience,
that is inevitable. It must respond to everything—to the river, to the diseased animal, to
the dead body being carried away to be burnt, to the poor villagers carrying their burdens
along the road, to the tortures and miseries of life—otherwise it is already dead; but it
must be capable of responding without being held by the experie nce. It is tradition, the
accumulation of experience, the ashes of memory, that make the mind old. The mind that
dies every day to the memories of yesterday, to all the joys and sorrows of the past—such
a mind is fresh, innocent, it has no age; and without that innocence, whether you are ten
or sixty, you will not find God.  
> -- Jiddu Krishnamurt, The Book of Life, Die every day

### Memento mori

> Death smiles at us all; all we can do is smile back  
> ― Marcus Aurelius

> The idea is to die young as late as possible  
> ― Ashley Montagu

> This life is only a prelude to eternity, where we are to expect another original, and another state of things. We have no prospect of heaven here but at
a distance; let us therefore expect our last hour with courage. The last, I say, to our bodies, but not to our
minds. Our luggage we leave behind us, and return as naked out of the world as we came into it. The day which we fear as our last is but the birthday of our
eternity; and it is the only way to it. So that what we fear as a rock, proves to be but a port, in many cases to be desired, never to be refused.
And he that dies young has only made a quick voyage of it  
> -- Seneca. Consolations against death
 
> Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.  
> The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.  
> ...  
> It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot.  
> ― Carl Sagan, [Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot_(book))

> ― Sir Winston Churchill

> The greatest thing in this world is not so much where we are, but in what direction we are moving.

> Я всю жизнь выписывал пословицы, которые мне нравились своей глубиной и точностью. Причем, не просто выписывал, а искал и находил решение трудных проблем. Когда появлялись дети, и я им вместо пустых назиданий давал эти пословицы.
Очень часто сила, свет этих народных указаний выручала меня, подбадривала, наставляла, утешала.  
> ― Александр Солженицын

### Limitations of language
> When the sage points at the moon, the fool looks at the finger
>> Truth has nothing to do with language. Truth is like Moon in the sky and language is like the finger that points to the moon. A finger can point out where the moon is, but the finger is not the truth. You can see the moon without help of any fingers, can you?

> -- Chan Buddhist scripture [Platform Sutra](https://www.quora.com/Does-the-saying-When-the-sage-points-at-the-moon-the-fool-looks-at-the-finger-really-have-Chinese-origins)

> Wisdom cannot be passed on. Wisdom that a wise man attempts to pass on always sounds like foolishness..  
> .. One can pass on knowledge but not wisdom. One can find wisdom, one can live it, one can be supported by it, one can work wonders with it, but one cannot speak it or teach it. I sometimes suspected this even as a youth; it is what drove me from my teachers..   
> .. Words do no justice to the hidden meaning. Everything immediately becomes slightly different when it is expressed in words, a little bit distorted, a little foolish. And that too is good and pleases me very much. It is perfectly fine with me that what for one man is precious wisdom for another sounds like a foolery.  
> -- Hermann Hesse in Siddhartha.

> So, what is important is **not to ask, “What is the purpose of life, of existence?” but to clear the confusion that is within you. It is like a blind man who asks, “What is light?”** If I tell him what light is, he will listen according to his blindness, according to his darkness; but suppose he is able to see, then, he will never ask the question “what is light?” It is there.  
-- Jiddu Khrishnamurti, The Book of Life
